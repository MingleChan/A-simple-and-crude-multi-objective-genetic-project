# A simple and crude multi-objective genetic optimization algorithm

### There are seven algorithms to construct the non-dominated set, which included in the folder "ConsAlgorithms".

### There are five algorithms to keep the distribution of the population, which included in the folder "KeepDistriAlgorithms".

### And there are 5 problems included in the folder "Problems", they are DTLZ1â€”DTLZ5.

The interfaces to call these algorithms are in the folder "main".
