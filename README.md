# A simple and crude multi-objective genetic optimization algorithm

I am a normal college student in China who major in **electronic information engineering**. 

This project is the result of my graduation design. 

It's my first contact in this area, and I am really not good at it.

Just push it, and I don't intend to update this project later.

### There are seven algorithms to construct the non-dominated set, which included in the folder "ConsAlgorithms".

### There are five algorithms to keep the distribution of the population, which included in the folder "KeepDistriAlgorithms".

### And there are 5 problems included in the folder "Problems", they are DTLZ1â€”DTLZ5.

The interfaces to call these algorithms are in the folder "main".
